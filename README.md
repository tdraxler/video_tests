## Video Tests

Just trying to understand Spring Boot and serving video and other media to clients.

## How to run this
Will add to this later.

## Sources

I couldn't have figured this out on my own. I followed some tutorials and other references:

- [Tutorial for serving video files with Spring Boot](https://www.vinsguru.com/spring-webflux-video-streaming/)
- [Reference for Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html)
